Question 4
[Java Programming]
[25 Marks] 

Sherlock Holmes was your colleague in 2SH4 this semester then he got an internship in T$LA Motors, a startup working on the field of autonomous driving. 
Specifically, Sherlock was in the team developing the software for V2V communication: A project aims at enabling cars on the road to drive cooperatively. 
Sherlock's manager asked him to write a method for automatic safety checking of the cars such that it monitors the all the cars on the road and determines if any two cars 
(or more) are possible to collide. 
To make it easy for Sherlock, his manager told him that he gets the information about all the cars on the road as an array input to his method.
His manager also told him that:
**Two safety zones of two cars are:
- "not intersecting" (Green) if the summation of their radii is smaller than the distance between their centers. 
- "tangential" (Yellow) if the summation of their radii is exactly equal to the distance between their centers. 
- "intersecting" (Red) if the summation of their radii is larger than the distance between their centers.
Sherlock goes back to his 2SH4 notes and looks for some hints. 
He found that he wrote a Circle class (you find it in the MyCircle.java file), which he can use to model 
the safety zone of each car. 
Then, he writes the following prototype of the method:

String CollideDetection(Circle[] cars)

which takes as input an array of Circle objects and returns a String as follows:

- "Red": if at least two circles intersect
- "Yellow": If no circles intersect AND at least two circles become tangential
- "Green" : if there are no tangential or intersecting circles at all

Afterwards, Sherlock was stuck, he seeks your help. 

(a) [12 Marks] You are required to help him by completing the implementation of the CollideDetection method below.
(b) [13 Marks] You are then required to help Sherlock test his method on 100 cars on the road in the main method below.
