/* Question 1
 [C Programming]
 [30 Marks]
In this question, you are required to implement a doubly linked list in C
The question has four parts, answer all of them in this same file*/
 
/*(a) [5 Marks] write structure Node that holds an integer value, a pointer to the previous node as well as a pointer to the next node*/
//Answer:







/*(b) [5 Marks] Write structure SLL that represents the doubly linked list and holds a pointer to the first node in the list.*/
//Answer:








/*(c) [10 Marks] write function deleteNode, that takes as input two parameters: the head of a linked list "head" and the integer value to delete ("target"). 
You are supposed to deleate the node with the input value and return 1 if the target was found in the list. Otherwise, you should return 0 if the value does not exist*/
//Answer:




  
/*(d) [10 Marks] test your function in main by creating a list of 10 nodes and then call the deleteNode function to delete a certain value, make sure you check 
the correctness of the function behavior by comparing it against what you expect. */
//Answer:


int main(){
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	return 0;
